# CLI Bot

This is just a test to have a custom CLI tool in the Go language. In a platform engineering environment a tool like this could be used to provide:
- release manager with a simple way to fire releases
- on-call teams to execute same automated checks
- etc

Two systems have been introduced (AWS and Github) with just a mock response.
